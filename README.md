# TypeDate

This is a our repo for a dating application called, TypeDate, that focuses on the Myers Briggs Test Indicator, more formally known as MBTI. It will be inspired by Tinder and various dating applications.

## Setup:

I would highly recommend running this in something like Visual Studio Code, as it was pretty seamless for me in my experience.

You will need to have some installations installed before running the application:
	- Yarn
	- NodeJS

These two are mainly for hosting the server while you upload and work on the application. You can view your changes as you refresh the browser or application in real time.

### Steps:

You will need to install a few dependencies for the hosting.
 
### You will need to install -- "npm install --save-dev express core" on Linux for both MacOS and Windows. This is for the hosting of the "server.js" file in the /mbti directory.  

Next, work your way into the "CS321-MBTI/mbti/src/" directory and once inside just call "yarn" to build/update the application. Yarn will call the application from the "App.js" function/method.

If you have issues running you may have to delete the node_modules folder in the "mtbi" folder and call yarn again to rebuild the project.

Make sure to have the "server.js" terminal running alongisde by calling node server.js. This is used for the hosting of the site for now. 

Afterwards, just call "yarn run start" to start the application.
